         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Dr. <hi>Martin Luther</hi>'s Prophecies of the De≈øtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Downfall of the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> Religion.</head>
            <p>TO wa≈øte much time in the needle≈øs Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Learned, and Pious <hi>Reformer, Dr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi>
               </hi> would be as great an Impertinence as that of the young <hi>Rhetorician</hi>'s, who ≈øpent three hours in an elaborate Declamation on the refulgency of the glorious Sun-beams. They are both ≈øo apparent to any Rational or Inqui≈øitive Creature, that it would be but a Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie to applaud them; we daily enjoy the ine≈øtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of either: for as the one delivered us from that uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable darkne≈øs which fir≈øt brooded on the primitive Chaos, and hatcht nothing but Confu≈øion; ≈øo the other like a Friendly Pillar of Divine Light, kindly conducted us out of tho≈øe dangerous paths of Super≈øtition, and Idolatry, which would have led us into everla≈øting De≈øtruction.</p>
            <p>But if after all tho≈øe mighty obligations he has done all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> there ≈øhould any one yet remain bruiti≈øhly ignorant of his Virtues and Indowments, I ≈øhall in a word acquaint them who this <hi>Luther</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was he who (if I may ≈øpeak it with reverence) like our <hi>Saviour</hi> had the honour to be prophe≈øied of before he was born; and this even the <hi>Romans</hi> them≈øelves cannot deny, ≈øince their own Hi≈øtories acquaint us that one <hi>John Hilton</hi> a per≈øon they them≈øelves held in great veneration for piety and gift of Prophecie, wrote thus almo≈øt a hundred years before <hi>Luther</hi> had declared him≈øelf again≈øt the Church of <hi>Rome. Much about the year</hi> 1516. <hi>the <hi>My≈øterie of Vngodline≈øs</hi> ≈øhall begin to be di≈øcovered, and the Son of Righteou≈øne≈øs ≈øhine forth in the Truth of the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> and Popery ≈øhall in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other parts of the World then receive a Sudden Declen≈øion.</hi> This
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29840:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 42 -->Prophecie was certainly fulfilled by <hi>Laither</hi> who appeared at that time again≈øt <hi>Rome,</hi> and in ≈øpite of all her then domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tyranny gave her a greater blow than ever ≈øhe received either before or ≈øince.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was he of whom the Martyr <hi>John Hus</hi> on that day he ≈øuffered at <hi>Con≈øtance</hi> ≈øaid; <hi>You now roa≈øt a Goo≈øe</hi> (for ≈øo <hi>Hus</hi> ≈øignifies) <hi>but one hundred years hence you ≈øhall hear a Swan ≈øing, whom you ≈øhall not be able neither to roa≈øt, nor overcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It was he who was graced with the Honourable title of <hi>Ma≈øter of Arts</hi> at twenty years of Age. 'Twas he who while≈øt he was peru≈øing certain Books in the Library of the Colledge of <hi>Orphord</hi> happened to meet with a Copy of the Latin Bible, which he never had ≈øeen before, and having to his great admiration ob≈øerved there were more <hi>Evangelical</hi> and <hi>Apo≈øtolical</hi> Texts in it than were ≈øuffered to be read open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Churches, he thereupon ≈øet him≈øelf to the Tran≈ølating of the five Books of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> and afterwards fini≈øhed both them and the remainder of the Old and the New Te≈øtament, which was by ≈øome <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Bi≈øhops and Prie≈øts forbid to be read to the People. In fine, it was Dr. <hi>M. Luther</hi> whom God in his infinite wi≈ødom rai≈øed, and furni≈øhed with a ≈øufficient portion of Care, Courage and Learning to In≈øpect and Detect the damnable Super≈øtition and Idolatry of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he re≈øolutely performed, notwith≈øtanding all the Threats and Dangers he knew he was to go through if he per≈øi≈øted in ≈øo doing. And la≈øtly it was he to whom <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Denmark, Bohemia</hi> and mo≈øt of the Prote≈øtant Churches in the world are in a great mea≈øure beholding for their glorious Reformation.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought fit to premi≈øe, that the mo≈øt ≈øcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Reader may le≈øs wonder that the Almighty ≈øhould entru≈øt this worthy Champion of the now Reformed Religion with the Spirit of Prophecie which he was plea≈øed to exerci≈øe on him≈øelf, ≈øaying ≈øome weeks before he Dyed, <hi>When I return to</hi> Wittemberg, <hi>I will be lodged in a Coffin, and will render to the worms a fat</hi> Luther <hi>to feed on;</hi> and ≈øo it ≈øell out, for within two dayes after he came thither he dyed, but a little before his Expiration call'd for Pen and Ink, and wrote this following Ver≈øe,

                  <!-- PDF PAGE 43 -->
Pe≈øtis eram vivens, moriens ero mors tua Papa.</q> Which <hi>Melancthon,</hi> one of his dear Friends, taking as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick rapture, turned into a Di≈øtick of the ≈øame mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Thus,
<q>
                  <l>Qui fuit dum vixit tua pe≈øtis <hi>(Papa) Lutherus,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Hic tibi cau≈øa, ≈øuo funere, mortis erit.</l>
               </q> Both of which may be thus paraphra≈øtically turned into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øh:
<q>
                  <l>As <hi>Luther</hi> Living was <hi>Romes</hi> plague, ≈øo ≈øhall</l>
                  <l>Her Fall be caus'd by his mourn'd Funeral.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But long before this <hi>Luther</hi> was ob≈øerv'd by all the Students at <hi>Wittemberg</hi> to be endowed with the Spirit of Prophecie which he frequently committed to po≈øterity, the greate≈øt part of which were in pre≈øaging the Di≈ø≈øolution of tho≈øe two grand temporal enemies of truth and Religion, the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the later of which, in <hi>Luther Colloq. p.</hi> 328. he thus prophe≈øieth, <hi>The <hi>Pope</hi> mu≈øt fall and Popery with him, ≈øince it is downright Bla≈øphemy to hold as he does,</hi> viz. <hi>that the final cau≈øe of the In≈øtitution of Humane Traditions, is the true Service and wor≈øhip of God: and that it is nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øalvation; contrary to that of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>If either we or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Doctrine to you than what we have preached, let him be accur≈øed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In another Prophecie <hi>Luther</hi> thus Inferreth the <hi>Popes</hi> Downfall. <hi>Idem pag.</hi> 312. <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> ≈øayes he, <hi>mu≈øt fall, and it plainly appears that the <hi>Pope</hi> is the true <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi> becau≈øe tho≈øe that tran≈øgre≈øs his Decrees or violate his Statutes are far more vigorou≈øly and ≈øeverely puni≈øhed than tho≈øe who offend the Laws of God, which is a palpable exalting of him≈øelf above the Almighty, and therefore he is mo≈øt properly called <hi>Antichri≈øt,</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again ≈øays <hi>Luther,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> mu≈øt and ≈øhall fall by rea≈øon the blindne≈øs of the Popelins is ≈øo great and horrible that they hold the Reconciliation of the Living (which though they pretend is a Sacrifice) yet all their Canoni≈øts, School-Divines and Pulpit preachers utterly di≈øapprove it.</p>
            <p>And in another place he predicts the <hi>Papal</hi> overthrow thus, The <hi>Pope</hi> ≈øayes he, mu≈øt fall, for that like a right Jew he boa≈øteth to enjoy by Chri≈øt a Temporal Kingdom, he alone
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29840:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 43 -->will have all the Power, and Authority, he will rule and De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termine all Councils, and incroach upon them under the Name of Chri≈øt. If one ≈øhould have de≈ølowred the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> or Crucified Chri≈øt, yet the <hi>Pope</hi> for money would undertake to pardon and forgive the ≈øame. Therefore his Dominion is but ≈øhort and will be brought to ruine according to the time ≈øignified by the number of the Bea≈øt, in the thirteenth of the <hi>Revelations. Page</hi> 306.</p>
            <p>Again ≈øaith he, Popedom mu≈øt fall, for that it hath been alwayes managed by wicked per≈øons and corre≈øpondent to the impiety of their Doctrine: for as the Creator is in this ca≈øe, ≈øuch mu≈øt be the Creature. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> was a <hi>Moran,</hi> that is a Baptized Jew, he believed nothing at all; he had a Concubine called <hi>Lucretia</hi> to whom he after e≈øpou≈øed his own Son. The <hi>Pope</hi> that ≈øucceeded him was ≈øo great an Enemy to him, that he cau≈øed all the Windows, Gates, Doors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereon his Name or Armes were fixed, to be demoli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or pulled down. When <hi>God</hi> ≈øpeaketh the word, [<hi>Rome</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy'd and lye in A≈øhes; <hi>Pope</hi> come down from your Throne,] the word of God will be obeyed and mu≈øt be immediately brought to pa≈øs: <hi>L. Colloqu.</hi> 302.</p>
            <p>Pride, again ≈øaith <hi>Luther,</hi> mu≈øt undoubtedly have a Fall, and con≈øequently ≈øo mu≈øt the <hi>Pope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of his remarkable prophecies to the ≈øame purpo≈øe is expre≈øt (in <hi>Lu.</hi> time <hi>p.</hi> 314.) to this effect. The <hi>Pope</hi> and his accomplices pre≈øuming on their great power that they ≈øhall never fall, do thereby ha≈øten their fall; and God will overthrow him, and that ≈øuddenly, if our own Securene≈øs, and contempt of Gods word does not hinder it: Let us pray therefore that the ≈øame misfortunes they de≈øign us, may light on their own heads: they have Burned, Hanged, Drowned and Bani≈øhed tho≈øe that were among≈øt us, they will in no wi≈øe be recalled from their Devili≈øh Practi≈øes.</p>

            <p>God Almighty has cho≈øen out <hi>Mich.
